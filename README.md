# My awesome dot files
My collection of dot files, so I feel at home whenever I move to a different environment :)

## Setup

First things first, install *Oh my Zsh!*
```
curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
```

Now you just have to run
```
./install.sh
```

And you will have a bunch of useful console and git aliases.
